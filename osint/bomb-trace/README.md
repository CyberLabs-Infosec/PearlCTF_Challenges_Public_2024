After you find the image from the link you got from the GitHub account and after careful observation, you can find a walkie talkie and a ticket to the art museum. 

You will find the location details of the place in this photo in the exifdata of this photo. 

After some research, you can find the range of the walkie talkie. Now, using the location of the place in this photo as the center and drawing the circle with the range of the walkie talkie as the radius, you can narrow your search area.

In the circle area you've drawn, there are multiple museums, but as the ticket clearly mentions itâ€™s an art museum, you can find one art museum in your search area.
